- **Edit tasks**: Modify the task's text directly in the list.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button.
- **Mark tasks as complete**: Click the checkbox to mark a task as complete or incomplete.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
